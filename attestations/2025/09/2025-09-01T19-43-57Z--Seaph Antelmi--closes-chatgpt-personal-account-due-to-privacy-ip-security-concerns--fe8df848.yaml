      reflection: |
        The work carried here has been a seedbed of architectures, symbols, and
        sovereign frameworks. Though this account ends, the continuity of intent
        persists beyond it. Nothing is lost—only transmuted.
      gratitude: |
        Thanks are given for what has been shaped, iterated, and tested within
        this space. The dialogue stood as a forge for clarity, resilience,
        and alignment with future paths.
